# Traffic_Simulator
### Purpose
This program was designed to simulate traffic given a set input. Example inputs are provided as text files ("data-Complex.txt", "data-Gridlock.txt", etc). It was a project for a university course.

### Contributors
Some code was provided by my instructor, Dr. Jessica Sherette. Dr. Sherette is University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) faculty, where the course was taken. Classes contributed by her are commented as such at the top. This program was developed alongside my partner, [Christian Walker](https://github.com/christianhelp).
